	  desc: "Short and stout the dwarves are bold and hardy and are known as skilled warriors.  As wide as they are tall a dwarf often waieghs as much as a human standing 2 feet taller.  They have long lives often living to 400 years and so carry grudges far longer than any human might.  They live in clans which band together to form knigdoms, living underground where they mine the minerals and riches they covet and turn them into wonders.  An adventuring dwarf is oten motivated by a desire for treasure.  Though many are either inspired or commanded by a diety to bring glory."
